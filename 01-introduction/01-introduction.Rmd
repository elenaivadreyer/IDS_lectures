# Introductions

### Course

`r fa('globe')` https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21

Much of this course lives on GitHub. You will find lecture materials, code, assignments, and other people's presentations there. We also have Moodle, which is is for everything else.

### Me

`r fa('address-book')` I'm [Simon Munzert](https://grantmcdermott.com/) [si’mən munsɜrt], or just Simon [saɪmən].

`r fa('envelope')` [munzert@hertie-school.org](mailto:munzert@hertie-school.org)

`r fa('graduation-cap')` Assistant Professor (data science and public policy)

# The labs

.pull-left-wide[

## Who & how

- This course is accompanied by labs administered by **Lisa Oswald** and **Tom Arend**.
- The labs are mandatory. Please attend them.
- As with the regular classes, please stick to the lab you are assigned to.

## What for

- What these sessions are meant for:
  - Discussion of issues related to the content covered in the lecture
  - Discussion of issues related to the assignments
  - Boosting your R skills
- What these sessions are **not** meant for: 
  - Solving the assignments for you

# Class etiquette

.pull-left-wide[
- Learning programming with R can be challenging and might lead you out of your comfort zone. If you have problems with the pace of the course, let me know. I expect your commitment to the class, but **I do not want anyone to fail.**
- You are all genuinely interested in data science. But there is also considerable variation in your backgrounds. This is how we like it! Some sessions will be more informative for you than others. If you feel bored, **look out for and help others**, or explore other corners of R you don't know yet.
- The pandemic is still around. We are differentially affected by it. We are located in different time zones. **Let's support each other.** 
- **Be respectful** to each other, all the time.
- **Ask questions** whenever you feel the need to do so!

- This course equips you with conceptual knowledge about the data science pipeline and coding workflow, data structures, and data wrangling.
- It enables you to apply this knowledge with statistical software.
- It prepares you for our other core courses and electives as well as the master’s thesis.

# Why R and RStudio?

### Data science positivism

- Alongside Python, R has become the *de facto* language for data science.
  - See: [*The Impressive Growth of R*](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/10/10/impressive-growth-r/), [*The Popularity of Data Science Software*](http://r4stats.com/articles/popularity/)
- Open-source (free!) with a global user-base spanning academia and industry.
  - "Do you want to be a profit source or a cost center?"

--

### Bridge to multiple other programming environments, with statistics at heart

- Already has all of the statistics support, and is amazingly adaptable as a “glue” language to other
programming languages and APIs.
- The RStudio IDE and ecosystem allow for further, seemless integration.

--

### Path dependency

- It's also the language that I know best.
- (Learning multiple languages is a good idea, though.)

# Attendance

## General rules

- Switching on-site groups will not be possible during the course of the semester. - However, if you happen to be unavailable on your slot but not on the other, please tune in (**only online!**). Also, please let Ayamba know (see below).
- You cannot miss more than two sessions. If you have to miss a session for medical reasons or personal emergencies, please inform Examination Office.
- We will check attendance on-site + online. If you attend online, type your full name in the chat when you log in.
- For on-site attendance, the current Hertie hygiene rules apply!

--

## On-site rotation scheme

- There is more interest in attending the course on-site than we have space.
- I have set up a rotation scheme that tries to balance on-site attendance across participants, within groups. Check it out on Moodle.
- If you are not listed as on-site participant for a particular session, please do not sneak into the on-site session. 
- **If you plan to attend online instead of on-site on short notice**, please drop Ayamba ([kwoyila@hertie-school.org](mailto:kwoyila@hertie-school.org)) a line until Wednesday noon so that she can inform successors. 


---

# Office hours and advice

-  If you want to discuss content from class, please first do so in the lab sessions. 
- If you still need more feedback, get in touch with me (`r fa('envelope')` [munzert@hertie-school.org](mailto:munzert@hertie-school.org)).
- If you want to discuss any other matters with me, just drop me a message and we'll arrange a meeting.
- My (virtual) office hours (by appointment) are Tuesdays, 3-4pm CET.
- For general technical advice, the [Research Consulting Team at the Data Science Lab](https://hertie-data-science-lab.github.io/research-consulting/) is there for you.

# Assignments and grading

| Component                           | Weight |
|:-|-:|
| 4 × homework assignments (10% each) | 40% |
| 1 × workshop presentation	  	| 25% |
| 1 × final data science project	        | 35% |

--

### Homework assignments 
- The assignments are distributed via our own [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/88543430-introduction-to-data-science).
- Each assignment is a mix of practical problems that are to be solved with R.
- You are encouraged to collaborate, but everyone will hand in a separate solution.
- There will be 5 assignments (one every ~2 weeks) and the 4 best will contribute to the final grade.
- You'll have roughly 2 weeks to work on each assignment.
- You submit your solutions via GitHub Classroom.
- Grades will be based on (1) the accuracy of your solutions and (2) the adherence of a clean and efficient coding style that you will learn in the first sessions.

| 1 × final data science project	        | 35% |

### Workshop presentation
- About halfway through the semester, we will flip the roles and you will become the instructor for one session of a workshop on **Tools for Data Science**. Whether this will happen onsite (hybrid) or online will still be determined.
- You, in (randomly allocated) groups of 2 students, will present a preexisting tool or package that is useful for the data science workflow.
- Topics are listed on [GitHub](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-21/workshop-presentations) and will be randomly allocated.
- Your contribution will include
  1. A lightning talk (recorded) where you briefly introduce and motivate the tool
  2. A hands-on session where you showcase the tool and provide practice material
- Both the talk and the prepared exercise materials, which must also be hosted openly on GitHub, will be graded.

| 1 × final data science project	        | 35% |

### Final data science project
- In the component, to be submitted a couple of weeks after classes have finished, you will design and implement your own data science project.
- You are supposed to collaborate in groups of two or three students.
- Student groups choose their topic subject to approval by the instructor.
- A wide variety of project types are imaginable and include
  1. A report about a statistical data analysis
  2. A policy explainer project enriched with data (think: a piece of data journalism)
  3. A dashboard to make data / analyses accessible in an interactive fashion
  4. An R package with a dedicated use case (e.g., API binding, visualization tools, etc.)
