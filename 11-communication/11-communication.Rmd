# Lasswell model of communication **for data scientists**   

Laswell's framework of communication<sup>1</sup> dissects the task of communication along the following dimensions: (1) Who communicates (2) what (3) in what form (4) to whom (5) to what effect?

Let's apply this to us. Data scientists communicate...

# Statistical communication

.pull-left[
### <b>What</b> we communicate
- The quantity of interest
- The selection/generation of data
- The empirical setup
- The model mechanics and results (estimates/predictions/uncertainty)

### Common challenges
- There's epistemological and statistical uncertainty.
- Effect sizes have implications that are often not easy to grasp.
- Many humans are bad at understanding (conditional and unconditional) probabilities.
- Conclusions about data science output crucially hinge on the validity of design aspects, which are extremely difficult to communicate.

# Written communication

.pull-left[

### When to communicate in writing

- For communicating to **the public and decision makers**, who want to focus on the conclusions, not the code behind the analysis.

- For collaborating with **other data scientists**, who are interested in both your conclusions, and how you reached them (i.e. the code).

### Authoring as part of the workflow

- Many different formats, including reports, briefs, blog posts, books, presentations, ...
- Form follows function: the write-up tool should talk to the analytic toolset.

# Authoring with R Markdown

.pull-left[

### What you already know

- R Markdown (and the `rmarkdown` package) helps you create dynamic analysis documents that combine code, rendered output (such as figures), and prose. 
- You can use it to
  - Do data science interactively with notebooks.
  - Modify the layout of your report.
  - Communicate your results with others.
- You take care of content, R Markdown of format.

### More resources

- The [official website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
- The [R Markdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/)
- [R Markdown - The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)
]

.pull-right[

### What you probably don't know (yet)

- R Markdown can do much more than reports. You can use it to author
  - Reports (in PDF, HTML, Word, etc.)
  - Interactive documents
  - Dashboards
  - Slideshows
  - Books
  - Websites
- It stands on the shoulders of [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), a package that converts markup files into virtually any other format.

# What are dashboards?

.pull-left-wide[
### Yeah, what are they really?
- A (business or data) [dashboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(business)) is a GUI that provides high-level overviews of performance indicators or other quantities of interest. 
- It's a **monitoring** (and not so much analysis) **tool**.
- Think of dashboards as a **mash-up of data visualization and report**.
- Dashboards are increasingly popular in businesses and organizations to **synthesize data points** from operative units (for strategic and analytical purposes).
- Data journalism has started to embrace dashboards in the context of [elections](https://edition.cnn.com/election/2020/results/president), the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://covid19.who.int/), and [sports](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-world-cup-predictions/).
- **Common features** are:
  - Accessibility via web browser
  - Featuring of interactives
  - Heavy focus on comparative visualization
  - Provision of trends on key performance indicators (KPIs)

# Why are dashboards?

.pull-left[
### Why are they a thing?

- There is increasing **abundance of data** (often process-generated) that cannot speak for itself.
- If used wisely, these data can provide an **important part of business intelligence** and a basis for high-level [evidence-based decision-making](https://stephanieevergreen.com/dashboard-conversation/).
- **Reduce information differential** between analysts and stakeholders but providing continuous quantification of indicators of interest (â†’ monitoring).
- Also, **measuring the health of organizations** can help stay in control (if only as a performative act) and satisfy managers' need for micromanaging.

# The problem(s) with dashboards

.pull-left[
### Design challenges

- **They say too little.** Loss of information is [fatal](https://stephanieevergreen.com/problem-with-dashboards/) for good decision-making when aggregating results into few KPIs.
- **They say too much** (irrelevant things). 
- Dashboards often fail not in technology but in communication (rooted in poor design).
- "Dashboards are not for show. No amount of cuteness and technical wizardry can substitute for clear communication." [Stephen Few](http://blogs.ischool.berkeley.edu/i247s12/files/2012/01/Dashboard-Design-Overview-Presentation.pdf), [Perceptual Edge](https://perceptualedge.com)
- As dashboards are a subgenre of data viz, so **all rules of good/bad viz apply**.
- So, there is hope since we do know a bit about how to design good visuals. (See [here](https://stephanieevergreen.com/dashboard-conversation/) for a nice case study on improving the design of a dashboard.)
]

--

.pull-right[
### Analytic challenges

- Dashboards supple the desire to be able to make good decisions on the basis of few selected metrics.
- This logic reflects a gross simplification of reality. 
- All challenges that pop up in careful analytic work - issues of selection, measurement, causality, predictiveness - are still valid but will be obscured when aggregating data. 
- Simple metrics can still be useful, but often you need contextual knowledge (which are difficult to communicate in dashboards).
- Another consequence of "dashboarding" business intelligence can be that by making decisions a function of metrics, they stop working well because they will be gamed.
]

---
# Good dashboard design

.pull-left[
### Do's and don'ts

- Try not to exceed the boundaries of a single screen. 
- Ensure desktop/mobile screen responsiveness.
- Work with interactives to make content conditionally accessible.
]

- In addition, consider the following:
  - Minimize distractions.
  - Focus on meaningful quantities of interest, not the ones that look cool.
  - Don't overload with information.

- Can only run interactive code client-fleside (in embedded JavaScript)

- Overview [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)
