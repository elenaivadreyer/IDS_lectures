# Lasswell model of communication **for data scientists**   

Laswell's framework of communication<sup>1</sup> dissects the task of communication along the following dimensions: (1) Who communicates (2) what (3) in what form (4) to whom (5) to what effect?

Let's apply this to us. Data scientists communicate...

# Statistical communication

.pull-left[
### <b>What</b> we communicate
- The quantity of interest
- The selection/generation of data
- The empirical setup
- The model mechanics and results (estimates/predictions/uncertainty)

### Common challenges
- There's epistemological and statistical uncertainty.
- Effect sizes have implications that are often not easy to grasp.
- Many humans are bad at understanding (conditional and unconditional) probabilities.
- Conclusions about data science output crucially hinge on the validity of design aspects, which are extremely difficult to communicate.

# Written communication

.pull-left[

### When to communicate in writing

- For communicating to **the public and decision makers**, who want to focus on the conclusions, not the code behind the analysis.

- For collaborating with **other data scientists**, who are interested in both your conclusions, and how you reached them (i.e. the code).

### Authoring as part of the workflow

- Many different formats, including reports, briefs, blog posts, books, presentations, ...
- Form follows function: the write-up tool should talk to the analytic toolset.

# Authoring with R Markdown

.pull-left[

### What you already know

- R Markdown (and the `rmarkdown` package) helps you create dynamic analysis documents that combine code, rendered output (such as figures), and prose. 
- You can use it to
  - Do data science interactively with notebooks.
  - Modify the layout of your report.
  - Communicate your results with others.
- You take care of content, R Markdown of format.

### More resources

- The [official website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
- The [R Markdown Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/)
- [R Markdown - The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)
]

.pull-right[

### What you probably don't know (yet)

- R Markdown can do much more than reports. You can use it to author
  - Reports (in PDF, HTML, Word, etc.)
  - Interactive documents
  - Dashboards
  - Slideshows
  - Books
  - Websites
- It stands on the shoulders of [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), a package that converts markup files into virtually any other format.

# What are dashboards?

.pull-left-wide[
### Yeah, what are they really?
- A (business or data) [dashboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(business)) is a GUI that provides high-level overviews of performance indicators or other quantities of interest. 
- It's a **monitoring** (and not so much analysis) **tool**.
- Think of dashboards as a **mash-up of data visualization and report**.
- Dashboards are increasingly popular in businesses and organizations to **synthesize data points** from operative units (for strategic and analytical purposes).
- Data journalism has started to embrace dashboards in the context of [elections](https://edition.cnn.com/election/2020/results/president), the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://covid19.who.int/), and [sports](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2018-world-cup-predictions/).
- **Common features** are:
  - Accessibility via web browser
  - Featuring of interactives
  - Heavy focus on comparative visualization
  - Provision of trends on key performance indicators (KPIs)

# Why are dashboards?

.pull-left[
### Why are they a thing?

- There is increasing **abundance of data** (often process-generated) that cannot speak for itself.
- If used wisely, these data can provide an **important part of business intelligence** and a basis for high-level [evidence-based decision-making](https://stephanieevergreen.com/dashboard-conversation/).
- **Reduce information differential** between analysts and stakeholders but providing continuous quantification of indicators of interest (â†’ monitoring).
- Also, **measuring the health of organizations** can help stay in control (if only as a performative act) and satisfy managers' need for micromanaging.

# The problem(s) with dashboards

.pull-left[
### Design challenges

- **They say too little.** Loss of information is [fatal](https://stephanieevergreen.com/problem-with-dashboards/) for good decision-making when aggregating results into few KPIs.
- **They say too much** (irrelevant things). 
- Dashboards often fail not in technology but in communication (rooted in poor design).
- "Dashboards are not for show. No amount of cuteness and technical wizardry can substitute for clear communication." [Stephen Few](http://blogs.ischool.berkeley.edu/i247s12/files/2012/01/Dashboard-Design-Overview-Presentation.pdf), [Perceptual Edge](https://perceptualedge.com)
- As dashboards are a subgenre of data viz, so **all rules of good/bad viz apply**.
- So, there is hope since we do know a bit about how to design good visuals. (See [here](https://stephanieevergreen.com/dashboard-conversation/) for a nice case study on improving the design of a dashboard.)
]

--

.pull-right[
### Analytic challenges

- Dashboards cater to the desire to be able to make good decisions on the basis of few selected metrics.
- This logic reflects a **gross simplification of reality**. 
- All challenges that pop up in careful analytic work - issues of selection, measurement, causality, predictiveness - are still valid but will be obscured when aggregating data. 
- Simple metrics can still be useful, but often **you need contextual knowledge** (which is difficult to communicate in dashboards).
- Another consequence of "dashboarding" business intelligence can be that by making decisions a function of metrics, they stop working well because they will be gamed.

# Thoughtful dashboard design and usage

]

.pull-left[
### Checklist before you start<sup>1</sup>

1. Are you tackling a monitoring task that needs your data/metrics to be updated frequently?

2. Who will use the dashboard and to what end? What questions will they use it to answer? What actions will they take in response to these answers?

3. What specific information should be displayed, and is it meaningful without much context?

4. What could lead to the metrics being wrong/misleading?
]

--

.pull-right[
### Design advice

- Minimize distractions.
- Focus on meaningful quantities of interest, not the ones that look cool.
- Don't overload with information.
- Apply all rules of good data viz.
- Use interactives with care (e.g., to make optional content  conditionally visible)
- Try not to exceed the boundaries of a single screen. 
- Ensure desktop/mobile screen responsiveness.

### <tt>shiny</tt> package
- Overview [here](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)
- More complex to program, but the best option for complex apps.
- Can implement any layout.
- Needs a server behind it to execute R code on user input. 
- Can run interactive code either by processing serverside (in R) or clientside (in embedded JavaScript).
- The [shinydashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/) package provides another way to create dashboards with Shiny

# The replication crisis

.pull-left-wide2[
### What the crisis is about
- The finding that many scientific studies are difficult or impossible to reproduce.
- Reproducibility is a cornerstone of science as an enterprise of knowledge generation â†’ bad.


### Factors fueling the replication crisis
- Solo, siloed investigators limited to small sample sizes
- Wrong incentives in science
- No pre-registration of hypotheses being tested
- Post-hoc cherry picking of hypotheses with best P values
- Only requiring P < .05
- No replication
- No data sharing

### Communicating the entire workflow

- Any decision - from conceptualizing measures to formatting tables - is meaningful for your output.
  - Tiny mistakes can have massive technical consequences (â†’ debugging).
  - Various decisions can have ethical implications (â†’ next session).
  - For others to follow (and potentially invalidate) your analyses, all the details are important.
- What makes the scientific endeavor unique is that it has self-correcting mechanisms. 
- But in order for them to work effectively, you have to **be transparent about every step in your workflow**.

- That's a meta meaning of communication: tell others, by publishing everything from input to code to output, what you've done.

# Towards open data science (cont.)

.pull-left[
### Good practice

- Pre-register designs `osf.io`, `aspredicted.org` 
- Do version control `GitHub`
- Public all research outputs (and inputs if possible) `GitHub`, `plain-text formats`
- Disclose and document software pipeline `make`
- Make preprints accessible `arXiv`, `osf.io`
- Public in open access journals
